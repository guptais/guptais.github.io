                <h2>Scientist Pattern for refactoring critical paths in a monolith</h2>
                <h6>26-02-2021</h6>
                <p>
                    These days I am working on a big monolith. I come across many long functions, some
                    thousand lines of code, frequently. There is not much test coverage available
                    so I don't feel comfortable to start any refactoring. As a result, I started discussing this with my
                    team.
                    I came to know about this pattern. It talks about running parallel implementations
                    (legacy and
                    refactored) of a function and then comparing the results over a period of time to build confidence
                    on the
                    refactored code.
                    I have not tried it yet, but keen to try it soon.

                <h2>Django Web App development: Beginner to Intermediate in a few hours</h2>
                <h6>18-02-2021</h6>
                <p>
                    <em>This post is for developers, like me, who want to try web application development without
                        learning
                        Javascript.</em>
                    </br>
                    I started with Django documentation. Django is a
                    web
                    application framework, so when I created the first app, it created a bunch of folders and files.
                    This gave me a
                    simple web app. Django provides an automatic admin interface to manage entity data. The html
                    templates css is
                    easily customisable.
                    Work out a schema with entity relationships which can give you enough overview of different things
                    offered by
                    Django Models. Ex. Shopping cart, Books checkout service, etc. This was the most time taking part. 
                    Now, extend the tutorial to fit that model. Start with simple independent entities. 
                    Journey Begins, have fun!
                    </br>
                    I am pleased to say, I am impressed how it turned out and gave me so much value for my time.
                    There is a lot of material available to learn Django web app development from awesome devs. Reach
                    out, if
                    you feel I should document a step by step tutorial of my learning path.

                <p>Once in every two months we organise a meetup targeted for the DevOps Community in Melbourne.
                    Currently we are more than 4000 members. The
                    objective is to act as a platform to bring industry leaders & DevOps advocates together to share
                    their experiences and Transformations stories. We organise talks and discussions around different
                    tools,
                    ideas
                    and best practices.
                    We also discuss pathways for graduates or career changers who wants to start a career in Software or
                    DevOps.
                    We try to have speakers from diverse backgrounds and different experience levels to share
                    their stories with the larger community to include different perspectives.
