<h1>Welcome to my World!<h1>

<h3>About me.</h3>

<p>
Food lover. I like cooking Indian and other vegetarian food from around the world.  
I like reading maps. I can spend hours reading maps.
I am a lot into movies. Cannot watch horror movies though. They leave me with bad thoughts. 
One part of me is a software consultant which likes to solves problems given I understand it.
I have finished reading Phoenix Project. Great book which connects organisational problems with the steps to achieve the solution. This book helped me a to understand what is DevOps and its relevance.

<h3>What's next after Cloud?</h3>

<p>
All the businesses are moving to cloud like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud or any other cloud provider.
It looks to me that all the companies are setting up their business based on how these cloud providers run. 
If due to any reason Amazon data centre get destroyed which is in Sydney, 
how would they provide services to the company whose whole website was hosted there.
