      <h2>Something about me</h2>
      <p>Writing code & drinking tea makes me a happy person. I am a post graduate in Applied Electronics and
        Theoretical Physics from University of Delhi, India. I studied Quantum Computers
        in university, which was very interesting then as well. I learnt coding from Pascal, moved to code in C, C++,
        C#, Java, Javascript and now Python. Technology is a life skill these days.
        Even if you are not in technical space, having some understanding of these things, can come really handy; And
        with the kind of online resources available, anybody can learn and start a new career or upskill themselves.
      </p>

      <h2>Story about my move to Australia</h2>
      <p> I moved to Australia from my home city, Delhi, India in early 2018.
        My friend Priyata Singh wrote about our move in her blogs. <a
          href="https://singhpriyata1.wixsite.com/quitekorner/post/crazy-asian-couple" target="_">Hustle and Bustle of a
          Relocation</a>. In this article I have also shared some tips with her for somebody
        who are about to relocate.</p>

      <h2>What do I do for a living</h2>
      <p>
        I am working as a Senior Consultant Developer & Data Engineer with <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/"
          target="_blank">ThoughtWorks</a>. It is a
        software services company, but nothing like one would imagine. I highly recommend more reading. Recently I have
        found myself working in Data integration projects, including but not limited to, Apache Kafka, which is my
        favourite so far.
      </p>
      <h2>Being part of the Community</h2>
      <p>
        I believe in sharing back to the community and make it less difficult for anybody to make a start in technology
        or STEM. I am a co-organiser of
        <a href="https://www.meetup.com/devops-melbourne" target="_blank">DevOps
          Melbourne</a> Meetup Group, with 4000+ members. We host a meetup every 2 months.
        I also like to organise and help with technical community events. I have helped in
        organising some workshops.
