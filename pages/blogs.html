      <h2>Django Web App development: Beginner to Intermediate in a few hours</h2>
      <h6>18-02-2021</h6>
      <p>
        <em>This post is for developers, like me, who want to try web application development without learning
          Javascript.</em>
        Start with a hello-world tutorial. I started with one included in Django documentation. Django is a web
        application framework, so when I created the first app, it created a bunch of folders and files. This gave me a
        simple web app. Django provides an automatic admin interface to manage entity data. The html templates css is
        easily customisable.
        Work out a schema with entity relationships which can give you enough overview of different things offered by
        Django Models. Ex. Shopping cart, Books checkout service, etc. This was the most time taking part. 
        Now, extend the tutorial to fit that model. Start with simple independent entities. 
        Journey Begins, have fun!
        I am pleased to say, I am impressed how it turned out and gave me so much value for my time.
        There is a lot of material available to learn Django web app development from awesome devs. Leave a comment, if
        you feel I should document a step by step tutorial of my learning path.

      <p>Once in every two months we organise a meetup targeted for the DevOps Community in Melbourne.
        Currently we are more than 4000 members. The
        objective is to act as a platform to bring industry leaders & DevOps advocates together to share
        their experiences and Transformations stories. We organise talks and discussions around different tools, ideas
        and best practices.
        We also discuss pathways for graduates or career changers who wants to start a career in Software or DevOps.
        We try to have speakers from diverse backgrounds and different experience levels to share
        their stories with the larger community to include different perspectives.
